Software Engineering Assignment 1.





NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF COMPUTER & EMERGING SCIENCES ISLAMABAD
CAMPUS
Software Engineering (CS-3009)| SPRING 2024
Due Date: March 5, 2024 [(11:59 pm) on GCR]
Assignment 1 – Iteration-0 – Planning Phase [50 Marks]
Instructions
- Use template in assignment folder for your assignment.
- You all must develop Web Systems in C# (it’s for coming deliverables).
- Turn in softcopy of your assignment (using group#_section.doc as naming convention) on google
classroom.
- One submission from each group is sufficient.
- You have THREE sprints after this Iteration-0.
- Kindly do not use ChatGPT for this iteration (especially to create user stories)

Tasks
In this iteration, along with other tools, we will use Trello and GitHub. Trello (https://trello.com/) is
an online message board maintenance application. Make an account and add collaborator (your project
fellows). Upload your product backlog, spring backlog for now and keep it updated throughout the
project. You will have to submit 3 snapshots for each sprint in all the forthcoming deliverables for now
You just have to submit snapshots of your product backlog and sprint backlog.
Also make an account on the GitHub for your code version management. After completion of
each task, you are required to push/merge your code (for coming deliverables) on the GitHub repository.
You are required to provide link of your GitHub repository.
Your document should include:
• Title of your project
• A structured Problem statement of Your Project (examples & format attached)
• A simple list of envisioned features as part of your project (e.g Book a ride, track an order, product
catalogue lookup, submit feedback, track shipment, place order etc).
• A set of user stories (at least 25) elaborating these features (Minimally you can draft one user
story for each desired feature). User Story format is also attached herewith. This will be Product
Backlog.
• Decide your roles such as product owner, scrum master and scrum team for this iteration and write
their duties (carefully).
• Link and screenshot (at the end of document) of your GitHub repository.

• Two snapshots of TRELLO message board showing three different stages of your
sprint backlog. You can breakdown your user stories into concrete tasks as well.
Prepare your board. Make cards for product backlog, sprint backlog and all necessary cards. For this
iteration, take snapshot-1 of prepare board with product backlog and snapshot-2 of sprint backlog
on the board.
Here is a description of why and how to construct features list and user stories:
To start on your project, you have to first understand what you’re building. At the start of this process, the
vision of the product is entirely in the head of your client and any artifacts they have produced (e.g. the
application they submitted to become a client for the class). Your job is to get these ideas out of their head
and in a list for the team that is concise yet precise. Not only that, but you need to understand which
features are essential and which are optional.
This list will serve as the basis for your list of project tasks to work on during the semester.

This list is important not just to seed your project management board, if you have one, but also to
document the initial understanding of features, so that, if things change drastically, you have a reference by
which to assess the degree of change (and perhaps justify to others why you didn’t get as much done on
your project as others, because of changes in the client’s desiderata).Requirements

Most product teams use a similar user story template, typically just a sentence or two written according to
the following formula:
User story examples
In practice, user stories might look like these:
1. As a database administrator, I want to automatically merge datasets from different sources so that I can
more easily create reports for my internal customers.
2. As a brand manager, I want to get alerts whenever a reseller advertises our products below agreed-upon
prices so that I can quickly take action to protect our brand.
3. As the leader of a remote team, I want our team-messaging app to include file sharing and annotation so
that my team can collaborate in real-time and keep an archive of their work in a single place.
Notice that the user stories can be a bit vague. For example, there are no details about where things are
displayed on the screen, or what the button labels might be. That’s OK. User stories are, not a water-tight
contract.
For this assignment, work with your client to capture user stories for all the features that he or she
envisions.

Also, work with your client to categorize the user stories into “need-to-have” features versus “nice-to-
have” features.

I expect that most projects will have between 20 to 40 user stories to capture the client’s requirements.
Note that the example user stories above did not describe things like colors, layout, or font sizes, nor did
they prescribe a particular approach to storing data. (If such things are important to your client, that’s fi ne,

but in most cases a client’s desires are not so precise at this point in the project. That precision will
typically come as the result of seeing and refining the UI designs.)
